## Feature #2: Add functionality

### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio so that the developer's projects and skills stand out.

### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the portfolio contents should be displayed  

### How are we implementing it?

- Complete the following features:
  - Use CDNs for content from libraries and remove the source code files from the project, as applicable
    - Note: CDNs are available for all libraries except Breakpoints.JS
  - In tablet view, show a fixed navigation menu instead of a hamburger menu
  - Convert the large image at the top of your portfolio to a video background or an image carousel containing at least three images
  - Add any other UI features that you feel will make your portfolio unique and personalized
